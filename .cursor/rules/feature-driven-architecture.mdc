When working on modern React and Next.js projects, folder organization tends to break down as the app grows.
You start with something clean, and six months later you’re digging through a maze of components, hooks, and utils folders trying to understand which file actually does what.

Feature Driven Architecture (FDA) is a pattern designed to solve that.
It organizes your application around features, not file types.
Each feature becomes a self-contained unit — small, composable, and easy to reason about.
What is FDA?

Feature Driven Architecture (FDA) is a project organization model where each feature owns everything it needs: API logic, UI components, hooks, schemas, stores, and types.

Instead of this:

src/
├── components/
├── hooks/
├── stores/
├── schemas/
├── utils/

You get this:

src/
└── features/
└── users/
├── actions/ → Server actions (Next.js server actions)
├── api/ → API routes or handlers
├── components/ → UI components specific to this feature
├── hooks/ → React hooks / client logic
├── lib/ → Pure utilities and helpers
├── queries/ → React Query hooks
├── services/ → Business logic or external integrations
├── schemas/ → Zod validation schemas
├── stores/ → Zustand or Jotai stores
├── types/ → TypeScript types and interfaces
└── index.ts → Public exports for the feature

Each directory encapsulates one complete feature.
You can open it and immediately understand its data flow, its components, and how it interacts with the rest of the system.
Why organize code this way?

Because scaling frontend projects is not just about performance — it’s about clarity.

Most architectures fail when the codebase grows and developers can no longer see where logic belongs.
FDA addresses this by enforcing natural boundaries around each feature.

1. Autonomy

A feature can evolve independently.
It can be refactored, versioned, or even extracted into its own package with minimal friction. 2. Maintainability

When every feature owns its logic, there’s no global soup of “helpers” or “components” to manage.
A new developer can onboard quickly by reading one folder instead of the entire project. 3. Testability

Since features are isolated, testing becomes straightforward — you test one vertical slice at a time, from API to UI. 4. Compatibility with Next.js

FDA fits naturally with the App Router, Route Handlers, and Server Actions.
Each feature can define its own API endpoints and export them into the Next.js routing layer.
How it works in practice

Here’s a simple example of how FDA integrates with Next.js route handlers.

src/features/admin/api/getUsers.ts

import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { getAllUsers } from "../services/userService";

export async function GET(req: NextRequest) {
const users = await getAllUsers();
return NextResponse.json(users);
}

src/app/api/admin/users/route.ts

export { GET } from "@/features/admin/api/getUsers";

This keeps app/api clean and declarative, while the actual logic lives within the feature.
The same structure works for mutations, queries, and server actions.
The index pattern

Each feature exposes a controlled public surface via an index.ts file:

export _ from "./actions/createUserAction";
export _ from "./queries/useUsersQuery";
export _ from "./components/UserTable";
export _ from "./schemas/userSchema";

Then you can import everything you need with:

import { useUsersQuery, UserTable } from "@/features/admin";

This creates a clear boundary between what’s internal to the feature and what’s meant to be reused.
A mindset, not just a folder structure

Feature Driven Architecture is more than just a naming convention.
It’s a mindset that encourages modularity, ownership, and clarity.
It treats each feature as a small, autonomous product — something that could, one day, live on its own.

If you’ve ever opened a React project and thought “where does this logic actually belong?”, FDA gives you a consistent answer.

Organize by what your app does, not by what it’s made of.
That’s the core of Feature Driven Architecture.
